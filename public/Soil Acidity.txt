pH Value
Soil pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the soil solution.
A well maintained soil pH will maintain the value of the soil resource, maximize crop and pasture choice and avoid production losses due to low pH.
Steps:
Depending on soil pH test results, agricultural lime may need to be applied to maintain pH, or to recover pH to an appropriate level. If the topsoil pH is above 5.5 and the subsurface pH above 4.8, only maintenance levels of liming will be required to counter on-going acidification caused by productive agriculture.
If the topsoil pH is below 5.5, recovery liming is recommended. Keeping the topsoil above 5.5 will treat the on-going acidification due to farming and ensure sufficient alkalinity can move down and treat subsurface acidity.
Liming is necessary if the subsurface pH is below 4.8, whether or not the topsoil is acidic. If the 10 – 20 cm layer is below 4.8 but the 20 – 30 cm layer above 4.8, liming is still required. In this case the band of acidic soil will restrict root access to the more suitable soil below.

Liming:
Liming is the most economical method of ameliorating soil acidity. The amount of lime required will depend on the soil pH profile, lime quality, soil type, farming system and rainfall.
Limesand, from coastal dunes, crushed limestone and dolomitic limestone are the main sources of agricultural lime. Carbonate from calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate is the component in all of these sources that neutralises acid in soil.
If soil pH is low, using tolerant species/varieties of crops and pasture can reduce the impact of soil acidity. This is not a permanent solution because the soil will continue to acidify without liming treatment.
