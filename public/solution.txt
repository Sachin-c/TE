If in Phosphate excess
High phosphorous levels in soil are usually the culprit of over-fertilizing or adding too much manure. Not only does excessive phosphorous harm plants, it can also stay in your soil for years. While there's nothing you can do to lower phosphorous levels immediately, options do exist to continue feeding your plants the nutrients they need.
Chemical treatment of using alum, ferric chloride and lime has shown excellent P removal efficiencies despite their expensiveness.
PotassiumIs in good conditionIf Sodium in excess
Salt-affected soils can be correcte:
1)Improving drainage
2)Chemical means
After the calcium treatment, the sodium can then be leached through the soil along with the other soluble salts. Gypsum is the most common amendment.
Calcium Deficiency
Calcium plays a very important role in plant growth and nutrition, as well as in cell wall deposition.
As a soil amendment, calcium helps to maintain chemical balance in the soil, reduces soil salinity, and improves water penetration.
Calcium plays a critical metabolic role in carbohydrate removal.
Calcium neutralizes cell acids.

Single Superphosphate   (SSP)
P: 8.8%    S: 11%   Ca: 19%
SSP has a high calcium content and is often used as planting fertilisers for horticultural crops where phosphorus is required and calcium is beneficial.

Phosphorus Deficiency
Phosphorus is a component of the complex nucleic acid structure of plants, which regulates protein synthesis. 
Phosphorus is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. 
Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant.
Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.

If in Nitrogen in excess:
In order to remove excess nitrogen in soil, you need to bind the nitrogen that is in the soil to something else.grow many things that bind nitrogen  in other words, plants. Any plant will use some nitrogen in the soil, but plants like squash, cabbage, broccoli and corn use up large amounts of nitrogen while growing. By growing these plants where there is too much nitrogen in soil, the plants will use up the excess nitrogen.Using Mulch for Removing Excess Nitrogen in Soil.
If Sulphur in  excess 
Sulphur also can be lost through soil erosion, and it can be leached away by water. But it never travels alone. 
If a field is flooded and the oxygen is removed, anaerobic microbes convert sulphate, the available form of sulphur, into the unavailable form. If the field stays waterlogged for a week or more, the microbes can convert sulphur to a gas, and it can be lost.
